Unproject
=========

Reprojects footage from a camera fixed into a car to make it appear as if the
image is being shot from overhead.

Prerequisites
=============

numpy
OpenCV (with Python bindings)

Usage
=====

See `./unproject -h`.

Gravity Vec
-----------

The gravity vec field is the sensor data reported by the accelerometer. Y
should correspond with out the top of the phone, X should be out the right
hand size, Z should be out of the screen.

The "Sensor Debug" app can be used to obtain these fields.

Camera height
-------------

Camera height from the ground plane. This in combination with pixel scale
determines with scale of the output.

Rotate
------

If the video is not orientated such that the top of the image corresponds
with the top of the phone, then this option must be used to correct for
the rotation. If for example, the video was show by turning the phone 90
degrees clockwise the top of the video will correspond with the left edge
of the phone. To correct for this "--rotate=1" should be passed so the input
video is rotated 90 degrees CCW and the top of the video corresponds with
the top of the phone.

Cameras
-------

See cameras.py to find valid camera names. If your camera is not present you
can add it by obtaining the relevant calibration parameters for your camera.

Calibration parameters are described here:
